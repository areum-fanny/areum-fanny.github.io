        <h3>Reading Response to Berger's Way of Seeing</h3>
        <p>
            I was intrigued by the different ideas presented in Berger's Ways of Seeing. 
            One of them was how adding different media such as music to pictures and different angles of shots changes the way in which they are interpreted. 
            I tried to remember fight scenes in movies where they zoom in and out of people's faces and fights to invoke different emotions to particular scenes.
            One more point he mentioned that I liked was that how there is a loss in detail when the pictures are being mass produced. Due to this lack of detail as the original art piece, 
            there is a change in meaning and interpretation. But with today's technology and high definition cameras it is poisible to replicate the details of the art pieces and bring it to the attention of the audience.
