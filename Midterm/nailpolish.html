                <div id="polishcontent"><p>Base coat should be your go-to option if you like your nail polish to set perfectly. It won’t look flaky and your manicure will actually last longer. 
                    The top coat is a lot different than a base coat, or your regular nail polish. It hardens your nails and protects the color you’ve applied,  so the color lasts longer than you are used to.

                <div id="polishcontent"><p>When we are talking about all types of nail polishes we got to mention the gel polish. Gel nail polish has got a thicker formula compared to the regular nail polish. These (depending on their formula) have to dry down under a UV lamp. Therefore, since they are curing, they can provide a long color payoff.</p></div>

                <div id="polishcontent"><p>Matte Polish is a nail polish that has a different dry down effect compared to a glossy nail polish. It is really still, straight and edgy. Matte manicures are mostly worn on the runway because of the pretty and steady colors, and especially because they can dry a lot faster. They don’t have any flashbacks on the pictures, which is really important</p></div>
