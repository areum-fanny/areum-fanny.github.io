            <div id="div1">Dubord's concept of spectacles was quite complex to understand. He says that "all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles" which made me think about how the mass media has overtaken most forms of entertainment in our lives (Dubord 1). </div>

            <div id="div1">According to Dubord, the spectacle is a "collection of images, but a social relation among people, mediated by images" and is "present model of socially dominant life" (Dubard 4, Dubard 6). This particular quote made me think about social media and how the images we post online is an online self and it is in relation with other online personas of people.</div>
