        <h1>READING RESPONSE</h1>
        <h2>As We May Think</h2>

        <p>In this article the author talks about the various innovations such as the camera and how these technologies could be improved in the future. She envisions the technologies that we might create and use in the future. He describes this technology called a <bold>"memex"</bold> and uses the word "repository" while talking about it which 
            immidiately reminded me of github. I could see that a lot of the technologies she talked about in the article have been developed and are in use now. 
            She mentions how that one day we would be able to see the pictures as soon as we take it and right now we have phone that are better than cameras used to be. 
            This reading was an intriguing piece.

        <h2>Long live the Web</h2>

        <p>Long live the web explains what the web is and how it has evolved. The web is a powerful tool if used properly and the article 
            explains how it is readily available for everyone to use. I liked how the author in the beginning suggests that the web might be "dead" in the future which made me wonder what could replace it if it does become obsolete. 
            There are lot of security risks to data and privacy and the web is often an easy point for hackers to hack into. The article briefly mentions the risks but the web has more to offer. As mentioned in the article, making the web available for everyone might increase the literacy level as there is tons of information that could be found on the web. 
            I wonder how the web would look like in 20 years and what more it has to offer.
