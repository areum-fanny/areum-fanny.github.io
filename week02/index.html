        <p>In this article the author talks about the various innovations such as the camera and how these technologies could be improved in the future. She envisions the technologies that we might create and use in the future. He describes this technology called a <bold>"memex"</bold> and uses the word "repository" while talking about it which 
            immidiately reminded me of github. I could see that a lot of the technologies she talked about in the article have been developed and are in use now.
